# About Me

Hi, I'm Dipankar Dutta, a student currently pursuing undergrad studies in Information Technology. I have a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

My expertise revolve around Classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I learn by implementing the ideas from scratch to know what goes under the hood as well as help strengthen my fundamental.

## Skills

- **Languages**: C++, Python, SQL
- **Framework**: Tensorflow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Streamlit
- **Developer Tools**: Git, Docker, PostgresSQL 
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV

## Projects

### Project 1: [Temperature Prediction Pipeline]
- [Github](https://github.com/MrPotato-00/Temperature_pipeline/)
[A fully automated end-to-end pipeline was built that was able to extract daily temperature of Delhi region and was able to predict the next day temperature based on the past 7 days data with a root mean square error score of 0.2. Data Engineering techinques were implemented to streamline the data extraction, transformation and loading to the database. The workflow was hosted on AWS (archived due to associated costs) and visualization board on Streamlit.]

### Project 2: [Clip Retrieval Model]
- [Github](https://github.com/MrPotato-00/clip_from_scratch)
[This is a clip-like retrieval model built from scratch using PyTorch and FashionMNIST dataset. Both image-to-text and text-to-image was implemented with retrieval accuracy of 84% and 80% respectively. Utilised a self-attention based image-encoder and Transformer based text encoder and used cosine similarity for bidirectional retrieval.]

### Project 3: [Image Captioning with PyTorch]
- [Github](https://github.com/MrPotato-00/imagecaptioning)
[Developed a CNN-LSTM based architecture using pretrained CNN model for image encoding and LSTM decoder to generative descriptive captions of images using the Flickr8k dataset. Implemented a beam search based decoding to improve text generation.]
